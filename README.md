In Chapter 3 we make, test, and deploy a Pages app that introduces templates and
class-based views. Templates are how Django allows for DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)
development with HTML and CSS while class-based views require a minimal amount
of code to use and extend core functionality in Django. They’re awesome as you’ll soon
see. We also add our first tests and deploy to Heroku which has a free tier we’ll use
throughout this book. Using platform-as-a-service providers like Heroku transforms
development from a painful, time-consuming process into something that takes just
a few mouse clicks.
